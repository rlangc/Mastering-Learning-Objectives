# Common Pitfalls in Objective Writing

Use this checklist to evaluate and improve learning objectives during the design or review process.

## Objective Clarity
- [ ] Does the objective state a **specific and observable** behavior?
- [ ] Can the behavior be easily **measured or assessed**?
- [ ] Does the verb used describe a **clear action** (e.g., "explain", "create", "list")?

## Avoiding Vague Language
- [ ] Avoid using verbs such as “understand,” “know,” or “appreciate”.
- [ ] Replace general terms with **measurable, action-oriented** alternatives.
- [ ] Is the **level of learning** appropriate for the audience (e.g., Bloom’s Taxonomy)?

## Alignment to Outcomes
- [ ] Is the objective **aligned with course or program goals**?
- [ ] Does the objective reflect the **right domain** (cognitive, affective, or psychomotor)?
- [ ] Are practice activities and assessments **aligned with the stated objective**?

## Overly Broad or Complex Statements
- [ ] Break down compound objectives into **multiple simpler objectives**.
- [ ] Does each objective address **only one behavior or skill**?
- [ ] Are the conditions and criteria for success **clearly stated**?

## Assessment Validity
- [ ] Is it possible to **collect evidence** of student performance?
- [ ] Does the objective provide a **basis for creating assessments**?
- [ ] Can someone unfamiliar with the course **understand and use the objective** to evaluate performance?

## Audience Focus
- [ ] Is the **learner** the focus of the objective (e.g., “the learner will…” or “students will…”)
- [ ] Does it describe what the **student will do**, not the instructor?
- [ ] Is the language **accessible to learners**?

## Final Check
- [ ] All objectives meet the **ABCD or other chosen format** (if applicable)?
- [ ] Do the objectives reflect the intended **scope and sequence** of instruction?
- [ ] Would another instructional designer or evaluator agree with the wording?
