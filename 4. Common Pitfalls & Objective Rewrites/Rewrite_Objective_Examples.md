# Rewrite Objective Examples

This document presents examples of weak or vague learning objectives alongside improved versions that are clear, measurable, and aligned to instructional goals. Each rewrite includes a brief explanation for clarity.

## Example 1

**Before:**  
"Understand the importance of cybersecurity."

**After:**  
"Identify three key reasons why cybersecurity is essential in enterprise systems."

**Why It’s Better:**  
The revised version includes an observable behavior ("identify") and a measurable outcome ("three key reasons").

## Example 2

**Before:**  
"Know how to use the LMS."

**After:**  
"Log into the LMS, navigate to the course dashboard, and submit an assignment using the provided interface."

**Why It’s Better:**  
"Know" is vague. The improved objective includes specific tasks that can be seen and evaluated.

## Example 3

**Before:**  
"Be familiar with workplace safety procedures."

**After:**  
"Demonstrate the ability to correctly follow five standard workplace safety procedures during a simulated drill."

**Why It’s Better:**  
“Be familiar with” is replaced by “demonstrate,” and it defines the scope of performance with clarity and precision.

## Example 4

**Before:**  
"Learn about customer service skills."

**After:**  
"Role-play a customer interaction scenario demonstrating three effective service techniques."

**Why It’s Better:**  
“Learn about” is replaced with a performance-based activity that aligns with skill demonstration and is observable.

## Example 5

**Before:**  
"Understand the company’s mission statement."

**After:**  
"Explain the three main values outlined in the company’s mission statement and provide one example of how they apply to your role."

**Why It’s Better:**  
The rewrite includes the specific behavior ("explain") and ties the objective directly to the learner’s context.
