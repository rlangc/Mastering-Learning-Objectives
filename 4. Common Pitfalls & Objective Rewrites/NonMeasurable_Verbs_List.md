# Non-Measurable Verbs List

Not all verbs are suitable for writing learning objectives. To ensure objectives are clear and measurable, avoid vague, subjective, or non-observable verbs.

## Common Non-Measurable Verbs to Avoid

These verbs do not indicate observable or assessable behavior:

- Know
- Understand
- Appreciate
- Learn
- Be aware of
- Be familiar with
- Grasp the meaning of
- Think
- Believe
- Value
- Comprehend
- Internalize
- Become acquainted with
- Gain knowledge of

## Why Avoid These Verbs?

These verbs lack specificity and cannot be reliably assessed. For example:
- "Understand algebra" is unclear, does it mean solving equations, recognizing patterns, or explaining concepts?
- "Be aware of cybersecurity threats" does not indicate what actions or demonstrations are expected.

## Tips for Rewriting

Replace non-measurable verbs with action verbs aligned to Bloom’s or SOLO Taxonomy. For example:
- Instead of “understand cybersecurity,” write: “Identify three types of cybersecurity threats and explain their impact.”

Use verbs that are observable, measurable, and clearly tied to learner performance.
