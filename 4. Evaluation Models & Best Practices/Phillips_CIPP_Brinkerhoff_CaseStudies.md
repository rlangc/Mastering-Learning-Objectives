# Evaluation Models: Phillips ROI, CIPP, and Brinkerhoff Success Case Method

This guide highlights three influential evaluation models beyond Kirkpatrick and ADDIE, offering deeper insight into program effectiveness and organizational value.

## 1. Phillips ROI Methodology

### Overview
Expands on Kirkpatrick's model by adding a fifth level: Return on Investment (ROI).

### Key Components
- **Level 5 ROI**: Compares program benefits to costs using a benefit-cost ratio.
- Emphasizes converting results to monetary values and isolating effects of training.

### Sample ROI Calculation
```
ROI (%) = [(Program Benefits - Program Costs) / Program Costs] x 100
```

## 2. CIPP Model (Context, Input, Process, Product)

### Overview
Developed by Daniel Stufflebeam, CIPP is a decision-oriented model used for continuous improvement.

### Four Evaluation Types
- **Context Evaluation**: Identifies needs and goals.
- **Input Evaluation**: Assesses strategy, plans, and resources.
- **Process Evaluation**: Monitors implementation.
- **Product Evaluation**: Measures outcomes and effectiveness.

### Sample Use Case
CIPP is used throughout a course lifecycle, providing actionable insights at each phase.

## 3. Brinkerhoffâ€™s Success Case Method (SCM)

### Overview
Focuses on identifying and studying successful (and unsuccessful) cases of training impact.

### Steps
1. Identify expected outcomes.
2. Survey to find high and low performers.
3. Conduct interviews and analyze enablers/barriers.
4. Report success stories and improvement areas.

### Application
SCM is ideal for qualitative insights, especially in pilot programs or new instructional designs.
