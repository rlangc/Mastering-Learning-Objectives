# ADDIE Model – Evaluation Phase Examples

The ADDIE model consists of five stages: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. This document focuses on the final stage—Evaluation.

## Purpose of the Evaluation Phase

To determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the instruction, inform revisions, and guide future development.

## Formative vs. Summative Evaluation

- **Formative Evaluation** – Conducted during development to improve content (e.g., usability tests, expert reviews)
- **Summative Evaluation** – Conducted after implementation to assess effectiveness (e.g., learner assessments, performance metrics)

## Examples

### 1. Formative Evaluation Tools
- Pilot testing with small learner groups
- Expert reviews using rubrics
- Heuristic evaluation for eLearning usability
- Walkthroughs and think-aloud sessions

### 2. Summative Evaluation Tools
- Surveys aligned to objectives and satisfaction
- Pre/post assessments and skill tests
- Observation of job performance
- Analysis of KPIs impacted by training

## Sample Checklist

| Evaluation Type | Tool | Use Case |
|-----------------|------|----------|
| Formative | SME Review Checklist | Content accuracy |
| Formative | Prototype Feedback Form | Usability issues |
| Summative | Pre/Post Test | Knowledge gain |
| Summative | Job Performance Checklist | Behavioral application |
