# Kirkpatrick’s Four Levels of Evaluation

The Kirkpatrick Model evaluates training programs across four levels:

1. **Reaction** – Measures how participants respond to the training.
2. **Learning** – Assesses the knowledge, skills, or attitudes gained.
3. **Behavior** – Evaluates how learning is applied on the job.
4. **Results** – Measures the overall impact on the organization.

## Sample Use-Case

**Level 1: Reaction**
- Survey questions on training relevance and engagement

**Level 2: Learning**
- Pre- and post-test comparisons

**Level 3: Behavior**
- Observation checklists and performance evaluations

**Level 4: Results**
- Metrics: productivity, quality improvements, ROI
