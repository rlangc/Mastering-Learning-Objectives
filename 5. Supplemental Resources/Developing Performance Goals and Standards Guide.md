# Developing Performance Goals and Standards

This job aid provides a structured approach to creating clear, measurable, and achievable performance goals and standards. It guides users through defining expectations, aligning goals with organizational objectives, and establishing criteria for measuring success. The aid is useful for managers, team leads, and employees looking to improve performance management and accountability.

    <td>1. Align with Organizational Goals</td>
    <td>Individual employee performance goals should align with the broader objectives of the organization, creating a clear "line of sight" between individual contributions and higher-level strategic goals. Goals should cascade from leadership down through each level of the organization, ensuring that every employee’s objectives support the success of their supervisor’s goals and, ultimately, the organization’s overall mission. By maintaining this alignment, organizations can drive cohesion, accountability, and collective success.</td>

    <td>2. Focus on Individual Results</td>
    <td>To develop effective performance goals, it is essential to clearly define the desired outcome or deliverable that should result from achieving the goal. Once the outcome is established, identify the key actions necessary for successful completion. This process helps create performance standards that support goal accomplishment and ensure alignment with organizational objectives.<br>
<br>
An outcome is a specific result or impact that contributes to the success of a supervisor’s goal or the broader organizational mission. For example, an outcome might be to increase situational awareness or improve border security within a given operational area.<br>
<br>
To achieve the desired outcome, organizations must define the critical actions required. These are the key steps or behaviors necessary for success. For example, to improve border security, a critical action might be to maintain a well-trained workforce with strong security awareness skills or effectively manage port infrastructure, including IT systems such as portals and computer networks.<br>
<br>
By clearly outlining both the intended outcome and the critical actions needed to accomplish it, organizations create a structured approach to performance management that enhances clarity, accountability, and strategic alignment.</td>

    <td>3. Include Measures and Targets</td>
    <td>Here’s your revised content with a sentence-based format for better readability and flow:

Each performance goal and its associated performance standard should include both measures—what is to be accomplished—and targets—how it should be achieved. These measures and targets must be realistic and attainable within the employee’s scope of responsibility.

Measures define what needs to be accomplished and serve as key indicators for tracking progress toward a desired outcome. There are two primary types of measures:

- Recurring measures are tracked over time and are often expressed as a rate, frequency, number, or percentage.
- Project-based or one-time measures are used for specific initiatives and are typically evaluated based on deadlines, cost, and quality levels.

Targets establish performance standards by specifying when or how something should be completed. They may be defined by deadlines, adherence to standard operating procedures, budget constraints, or other criteria. Performance standards can be based on managerial expectations, organizational objectives, historical performance data, customer requirements, or external regulations such as public laws and industry standards.

For example, a goal might be to reduce the number of service requests requiring rework (measure) by 3% to 5% (target) during the current performance cycle.

Tip: When possible, use target ranges instead of fixed numbers to allow for flexibility while maintaining performance expectations.</td>

    <td>4. Define Two Performance Standards: Achived Expectations and Achived Excellence</td>
    <td>Organizations that use a structured performance rating system typically define Goal Performance Standards at multiple levels to ensure clarity in performance expectations. Performance standards should be formally documented in work plans at both the Acceptable and Outstanding levels. Clearly defining these standards helps employees and supervisors assess and evaluate performance across all rating levels.
<br>
<h4>Performance Rating Levels:</h4>
     
1. Unacceptable (Level 1) – Performance falls below the acceptable standard. This level does not need to be pre-defined, as it is determined by failure to meet the Acceptable standard. If an employee’s work does not meet the minimum criteria, it is considered below the required retention standard, and appropriate action may be necessary.
2. Acceptable (Level 3) – Performance at this level ensures that key organizational goals and priorities are met. Employees rated as Acceptable have meaningfully contributed to their supervisor’s or the organization's overall objectives. Examples of performance at this level include:
    - Increasing the number of completed inspections by 8% within the performance cycle
    - Assigning all available slots for specialized training programs
    - Updating and testing contingency plans as required by regulations and policies
3. Exceeded Expectations (Level 4) – This level represents performance that falls between Acceptable and Outstanding. It is not pre-defined at the beginning of the performance cycle but is determined based on performance that surpasses Acceptable expectations yet does not fully reach the Outstanding level.
4. Outstanding (Level 5) – Performance at this level significantly exceeds expectations and often results in notable improvements, efficiencies, or cost savings. Employees who achieve this rating demonstrate exceptional contributions beyond standard requirements. Examples include:
    - Increasing the ratio of inspections to vehicles by 15% within the performance cycle
    - Conducting additional training exercises beyond the required drills, including collaboration with internal and external agencies to address specific challenges

By clearly defining performance standards at key levels, organizations can promote accountability, encourage high performance, and provide employees with a structured framework for success.</td>
    <tr>
    <td>5. Ensure Balance</td>
    <td>When setting performance goals and standards, it is essential to maintain a balance between competing priorities. Consider the following factors to ensure that objectives are realistic, achievable, and aligned with organizational needs:

- The need to increase speed or productivity while maintaining quality standards
- The need to meet project deadlines while ensuring cost efficiency
- The need to obtain necessary approvals while adhering to externally imposed deadlines
- The need to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction while controlling costs
- The need to achieve target milestones despite resource constraints, such as reduced staffing

By carefully evaluating these factors, organizations can establish well-rounded performance goals that drive success without compromising essential priorities.</td>

The Goals and associated standards must then be reviewed against the SMART criteria to ensure they are reasonable, fair, and easily understood.
