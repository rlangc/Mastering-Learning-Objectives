# Crosswalk of Learning Objective Frameworks

This document helps instructional designers translate learning objectives across three popular frameworks—Bloom’s Taxonomy, SOLO Taxonomy, and the ABCD Model—by highlighting parallels and distinctions in their focus areas and use cases.

| Component | Bloom’s Taxonomy | SOLO Taxonomy | ABCD Model |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Categorizes cognitive learning levels | Describes structural complexity of learner responses | Provides structure to clearly define objectives |
| **Levels/Stages** | Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create | Prestructural, Unistructural, Multistructural, Relational, Extended Abstract | N/A (structured by elements: Audience, Behavior, Condition, Degree) |
| **Focus** | Cognitive development and assessment alignment | Depth of understanding and learner response quality | Clarity and completeness in objective writing |
| **Application** | Course/module design, test planning | Scaffolding learning complexity | Writing specific and measurable objectives |
| **Common Use Cases** | K-12, Higher Ed, Corporate Training | Curriculum mapping, learning progression | Lesson planning, assessment alignment |
| **Strengths** | Widely used, straightforward verbs list | Emphasizes holistic learning progression | Easily translates to assessment and practice |
| **Limitations** | Can be rigid if misapplied | Less known, subjective interpretation | Doesn’t cover cognitive complexity progression |

Use this crosswalk as a reference when blending or choosing frameworks to support your instructional goals and evaluation needs.
